Team 8

Team Members: Abdulaziz Alateeqi, Fawzan Alfahad, John Michael Mertz, Meshal Almutairi, Michael Fontaine


## Project Background

Prolonged exposure to poor quality air can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and
cognitive decline. This is a major issue that plagues dungeon dwelling engineers and creators
across the world.

## Project Objective

Design an air vent unit capable of monitoring ambient air quality and automatically
(de)activating its fans to optimize airflow. The unit should dimensionally fit standard air vents.
